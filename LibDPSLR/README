CRD sample code provides several sets of software to read, write, convert, and 
test CRD files. These are provided "as is" with no guarantees. The software has 
been tested with a limited amount of data, and there may still be errors and 
incomplete implementation of standards. This software is meant to be a starting
place for those implementing and managing ranging data in the CRD format.
